## Notes for first-use

When the consuming agent invokes this connector for the first time:
1. Verify the live API docs against this stub
2. Update endpoint table with the calls you actually need
3. Add error patterns specific to this service
4. If implementing `client.py`, copy `.claude/connectors/perplexity/client.py` as the pattern
