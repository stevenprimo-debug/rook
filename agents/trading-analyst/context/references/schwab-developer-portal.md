Test in Sandbox

Sandbox environment provides the ability to test API methods, or HTTP verbs, without touching live Production data. Technical and non-technical API documentation is provided alongside a full-featured testing platform hosted within the Developer Portal. The Sandbox provides the ability to verify an App's OAuth 2.0 credentials and investigate API resource functionality.

> [!info] Info
> **API Documentation Questions**
> 
> Individual LOBs manage their own API documentation independently and may choose to publish their respective API Products in this API Explorer module.
> 
> Questions on specific API Product documentation should be directed to that specific API Product Owner.

**Functionality**

Sandbox testing provides visibility of inputs/outputs, or requests/responses, of data for each call. The data is rendered and persists within this module's UI until the next call is run. Like the leading HTTP post utilities, the full OAuth 2.0 workflow is replicated to include client (end-user) authorization steps. The resulting access token will automatically be used to authenticate API resource calls.

Schwab employs RESTful API design, architecture, and Swagger/OpenAPI specification framework to aid development efforts. Assets and artifacts such as API response object examples and API models alongside reference documentation are provided for technical teams’ development.

**Sandbox Test Data**

Sandbox data is carefully engineered to provide datasets for testing that simulate live Production environment data without exposing any actual live accounts or data. Using the resources described above along with your Company’s Sandbox App, you will be able to make calls and return sample responses. The test data represents an accurate cross-section of data commonly found in the live environment while implementing security and privacy policies to protect Schwab and our clients. The full featured testbed also includes error response scenarios where applicable.
